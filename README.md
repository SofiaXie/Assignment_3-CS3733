## Assignment_3-CS3733

The service request web page, App.tsx in the src folder, includes the items below. Place any additional TSX and
TS files in the src folder. Note that this is a front-end application. Instead of a database backend, you will just
store the form data into a state. See team coaching session on saving React form objects into a state.
1. A service request form that permits the user to enter information and submit it. The form contains the
following elements
a. Name of the employee making the request
b. Priority of the request: Low, Medium, High, Emergency.
c. Location of the request in the building. Just use a string for this assignment.
d. Create two fields related to the service request system you have chosen from the list below.
They should be something other than a text input box. For example, checkbox, radio buttons,
dropdown, etc.
e. Status of the request: Unassigned, Assigned, InProgress, Closed
f. Submit button. When this button is pressed, the data in the form is saved into a state.
2. A list of the submitted service requests. The data does not need to be persistent between application
invocations.

TASK: Medical device delivery service. For example, hospital beds, IV pumps, recliners, etc.
